                　　The library is the landmark of every university, and the libraries in each university have a huge amount of books.
                    How to make it easier for students and administrators to borrow and manage books has become an increasingly serious problem.
                    If the problem is solved, it will further enhance the efficiency of students' learning and research,
                    and students will no longer have to spend a lot of time looking for books.
                <br>
                <br>
                　　In order to better help students, professors and administrators borrow and manage books.
                    Our team decided to develop a book management system. Under this system,
                    students can look for books and read the book description to find out if the book is suitable for them.
                    If borrower decides to borrow the book,
                    Borrower only needs to find the book according to the location of the book in the library,
                    and then The book is submitted to the administrator,
                    who completes the lending process based on the book's ISBN and the student's ID.
                <br>
                <br>
                　　As an administrator, he can make an appropriate fine according to the availability of the book when borrower returns the book.
                    The administrator can also put the books in the right location according to the books' information which are provided in the website.
                    What's more, administrator also has the right to help borrower recharge.
                    It is no hard to image that without the system, people have to use lots of paper to write down who borrow the book and each borrower's account balance.

                Although there are only two people, we believe that more people will join us in the future.
                We can not only develop library systems, but we can also develop other applications.
                In addition, we can also carry out technical exchanges so that each team member can improve programming skills faster.
